uint batch_size;

array<array<firefly, n>, batch_size>;

First, we send the batch_size. Then we send
the batches. The batches should be sent in maximum 5 seconds.
After that, we send the batch_size again.

A batch consinst of more moments. A moment consists of more ticks.
A tick is represented by the array of fireflies.
A moment specifies how many fireflies we have.
The number of fireflies can't change in the same moment.
TODO: We might set moment = tick.
